## A Little About Me

My name is Hassan Veal and I am the head Coach of Caverinha Jiu Jitsu Family Kids located here in Iwakuni, Japan. I have been a practitioner of Martial Arts for many years and would love to coach your children. For many years now, my family and I have dedicated our lives to bringing the physical and spiritual attributes of Martial Arts to the lives of families and their children around the world.

I personally have had the great honor to train and learn from some of the greatest Martial Artist and Practioners around the world to include: Professor Benjamin Moriniere of the Capoeira Academy Okinawa Japan, and Mestre Aldo Caveirinha of Caveirinha Jiu Jitsu Family Hawii, which have grown, produced and groomed Focused, knowledgable, and confident instructors/coaches over the Years. 

In CJJFK classes are geared for children of all ages, shapes and sizes, our school itself has become a community of learning and growth. 

My family and I would love nothing more than for you to become a part of it. That way you too can enrich your life, learn self-defense, and get in great shape too. 

Through **Discipline**, **Focus**, and **Determination** we can help you move towards a happier life and a brighter future.

The desire to advance through the ranks begins to build goal setting and organization skills, building ambitions along the way. This soon turns into Self Confidence and Pride in what life has to offer.

My family and I are PASSIONATE beyond beleif about you having fun, training, and enjoying the family atmospher we bring to you through Martial Arts, paving the way to a new world of opportunites.

Whenever your ready contact myself on MCAS Iwakuni by phone or email and try out one of our classes. We offer private, semi private and regular classes ranging from 1-10 students per class. That way the children get the attention they deserve. 

It'll Be great to have you.
Sincerly,
Coach Hassan Veal
